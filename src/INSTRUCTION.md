S.2 SOTWARE II SEMINAR MRAC 2020/21

The Project SPARSE SELECTION aims to create a process pipeline to optimize the creation of point-clouds with the more accessible use of photogrammetry. The intention is to be able to capture data of areas with limited access, which is even a difficult task for grounded 3D-Scanners. With the use of UAVs, we are proposing a way for capturing data effortlessly and for the goal to use the scans beyond surveying.

#### 1. Overview

Digitization and new technologies give us the opportunity to bring back some architectural qualities, which are seen as not affordable if done by human labor alone. To rediscover form, pattern, and complex topologies in architecture and heritage, we propose the use of photogrammetry beyond surveying to create a library as a first step of the development of thinkable and unthinkable combinations and maybe a novel architectural language. The digitization of the construction sector is not only about reducing costs, it is the chance to rediscover “lost craftsmanship“.
